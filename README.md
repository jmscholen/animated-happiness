Here are two style guides bbatsov, Github.

Bonus: The two style guides disagree on hash syntax. Imagine you are writing your own style guide. Which Hash syntax would you promote and why.

Answer: I poised the question to a Github employee as to why they chose to insist on the hash rocket versus the colon and they could not answer the question. 

For my personal preference, I would choose the 1.9 version since it requires less typing on my part, although the hashrocket does look cool!
